My name is ___________, and I&rsquo;m going to be walking you through this session today. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Before we begin, I have some information for you, and I&rsquo;m going to read it to make sure that I cover everything. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">You probably already have a good idea of why we asked you here, but let me go over it again briefly. We&rsquo;re asking people to try using a smart watch app that we&rsquo;re working on so we can see whether it works as intended. The session should take about twenty minutes. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The first thing I want to make clear right away is that we&rsquo;re testing the app, not you. You can&rsquo;t do anything wrong here. In fact, this is probably the one place today where you don&rsquo;t have to worry about making mistakes. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As you use the app, I&rsquo;m going to ask you, as much as possible, to try to think out loud: to say what you&rsquo;re looking at, what you&rsquo;re trying to do, and what you&rsquo;re thinking. This will be a big help to us. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Also, please don&rsquo;t worry that you&rsquo;re going to hurt our feelings. We&rsquo;re doing this to improve the app, so we need to hear your honest reactions. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">If you have any questions as we go along, just ask them. I may not be able to answer them right away, since we&rsquo;re interested in how people do when they don&rsquo;t have someone sitting next to them to help. But if you still have any questions when we&rsquo;re done I&rsquo;ll try to answer them then. And if you need to take a break at any point, just let me know. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Also, there is someone from the app team observing this session in another room. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">If you would, I&rsquo;m going to ask you to sign a simple permission form for us. It just says that we have your permission to record you, and that the recording will only be seen by the people working on the project. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">[ ] Give them a recording permission form and a pen &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">[ ] While they sign it, START the SCREEN RECORDER </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Do you have any questions so far? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">OK. Before we look at the app, I&rsquo;d like to ask you just a few quick questions. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c0">Do you have or have you ever used a smart watch?</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c4">(If you did have a smart watch) what (would / do) you use it for?</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Do you use a calendar? Do you use any calendar apps? Which ones?</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">OK, great.
