        <h2>Know Your Enemy</h2>
        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>
            Existing smart watch calendar applications are lacking. They 
            cannot add events to the calendar or edit them. If they can do so, the typing 
            ability is horrendous. These applications are difficult to read and difficult to 
            use for many.
        </p>

        <h3>The Customer</h3>
        <p>
            People who have a smart watch that like to keep track of 
            events on their phone or Google account. <a href="#customers"> See 'Customers'</a>
			under the stakeholders section.
        </p>

        <hr/>

        <h3>Scope</h3>
        <p>
            We will design an interface for a new application that could be installed 
            instead of the existing calendar application. This application will only be 
            designed for square Android wear smartwatches and we will not be designing 
            ways in which the application could interact with other aspects of the watch 
            OS (notifications, etc.)
        </p>

        <hr/>

        <h3>Stakeholders</h3>
        <p>
            The most obvious stakeholder for any project is us, the team designing the application.
			Our goal is to make a viable design that pleases potential customers,
			in addition to being helpful and simple enough to implement in further stages
			of development. We must, however, be wary that our design does 
			not take us too long to come up with, lest the project may become
			too costly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another potential group of stakeholders is the rest of the team 
			that is a part of our project. This would include project managers,
			any developers that plan to use our design, and even any salespeople that
			rely on the overall success of the product. All of this group hopes
			that the application is easy and enjoyable to use and is completed
			in a minimal amount of time. They worry that our design may take too long 
			to implement and that the application as a whole won't be well-recieved by customers.
			We can continue to involve them by continually showing them our prototypes 
			as they are designed and requesting feedback based on their perspective.
        </p>
		<h5 id = "customers">Customers</h5>
        <p>     
            There are a few different types of customers we expect to take interest in our
			app. Managers, who tend to have busy schedules with lots of meetings. 
			Students, who would use the calendar to plan for their classes.
			And parents, who may use teh calendar to help them rembemer when 
			and where they need to bring their children. Since the app is
			for a smartwatch, we can safely assume that most cusomters will
			already be well aquianted with technology.
        </p>
        <p>
            Manager's want their calendar app to discretely remind them 
			when they have somewhere to be. They would want to be reminded 
			even if they are currently in a meeting, and unable to check their phone.
			They would worry that constantly checking their watch may make the person
			they're meeting with feel rushed, and less of a priority. As with all customers,
			the best way to involve them will be by allowing them to test the prototypes 
			as they come along, so their feedback can be implemented.
        </p>
		
		<p>
			Students need their calendar app to be aggressive. Students
			often have a reputation of sleeping too long and being late
			to their engagements as a result. Students may feel time pressure
			from the piling assignments in their classes, and would turn to
			a calendar app to improve their time management. Students worry
			that if their calendar app is not reliable, they may want more
			feedback to be sure that an event has been correctly added.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Parents are busy. They want to be able to add an event quickly,
			and if they have young children, then they will often be in a loud environment
			and incabable of relying on speech to text. Beyond that, they will share
			many of the desires and concerns of the other two groups.
		</p>

        <h3>Prototyping</h3>
        <p>
            We will prototype adding an event, viewing an 
            existing event, editing an event, and deleting an event. These are important 
            aspects to prototype because they showcase the main functionality of the 
            application and all of the unique pieces of the design. So, other areas of 
            the application that will not be shows will reuse parts of the design shown 
            in these prototypes.
        </p>

        <h3>Why Prototype?</h3>
        <p>
            If we were to jump headfirst into creating this calendar application without 
            first prototyping a solution, we may end up with a product that is difficult 
            to use and which does not meet the needs of all our users. By prototyping a 
            solution, we are able to test it and then iterate on the prototype until we've 
            arrived at a final product worth creating.
        </p>

            <li>Typing to add or edit an event</li>
            <li>Viewing a month at a time</li>
