            First, we had participants interact with our prototype for a few 
            minutes. They would make an action on the screen, and the researcher 
            would describe to them what visible results that action was meant 
            to have, in many cases this would mean directing them to a new screen. 
            To simplify the testing process, we came up with 11 questions, ten 
            of which targeted one of the Nielsen heuristics, and one which was 
            mean to encourage discussion with the participant. Participants 
            answered these questions about the experience they had with the 
            prototype.                
        </p>
        <p>
            After interviewing multiple participants, we started noticing some 
            redundancy in their answers. Below are the most common themes among 
            the answers we were given.
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Can you tell where you are in the app at all times? 
                <p>
                    <i class="fas fa-check" style="color: green"></i>
                    Yes, but not always on the date picker screens, especially if 
                    they've looked away for a while.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Do you think you would need to learn any new terminology or 
                iconography to use the app? 

                <p>
                    <i class="fas fa-check"  style="color: green"></i>
                    No, it uses the same icons that I'm used to from other 
                    apps. Navigation with swiping is sometimes unusual, 
                    though, especially on the typing screen.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Do you feel you can easily undo a mistake you’ve made, like 
                typing something you didn’t want to, or giving the wrong 
                information for an event? 
                
                <p>
                    <i class="fas fa-times" style="color: red"></i>
                    No, sometimes I'll get stuck in a menu that I won't be 
                    able to leave. (Date picker)
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Do you think the system can help you avoid making errors? 
                
                <p>
                    <i class="fas fa-times" style="color: red"></i>
                    No, there are no confirmation dialogs to help me avoid making errors.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Does the system make it clear that an error has occurred? 
                
                <p>
                    <i class="fas fa-times" style="color: red"></i>
                    No, there are no error dialogs.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Is the same ‘language’ spoken across the entire app? 
                
                <p>
                    <i class="fas fa-check" style="color: green"></i> 
                    Yes, although the time is displayed differently on a couple screens.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Do you think you can quickly recognize all available actions, 
                rather than needing to memorize them? 
                
                <p>
                    <i class="fas fa-times" style="color: red"></i>
                    No, navigation around pages can be challenging unless 
                    you've memorized all the actions.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Does the system continually reward its use such that experienced 
                users are able to gain more from the app? 

                <p>
                    <i class="fas fa-times" style="color: red"></i>
                    No, except that experienced users will understand how 
                    to navigate, but that should have been intuitive.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Is there any unnecessary information? 
                
                <p>
                    <i class="fas fa-times" style="color: red"></i>
                    No, in fact, there is not enough information, an animation 
                    describing how to navigate could be helpful.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                If you encountered a bug, would it be easy to find help to resolve?
                
                <p>
                    <i class="fas fa-times" style="color: red"></i>
                    No, I would have to Google it or go to the settings menu, but 
                    it is challenging to get to the settings menu sometimes.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Is there anything else you'd like to say about the app? Anything 
                you'd like to change?
                
                <p>
                    <i class="fas fa-times" style="color: red"></i>
                    The long and short of it is: it's hard to navigate through 
                    the app and some things are inconsistent.
                </p>

            All pages will use pinch to exit, instead of swiping down. The 
            animations will reflect this. On any page, they should be able 
            to long press to bring up button versions of the available actions.
