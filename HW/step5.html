        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <p>
            We altered <a href="https://www.sensible.com/downloads/test-script.pdf">Steve Krug's Usability Test Script</a> 
            to fit the needs of our hi-fi prototype. Then, we gathered 3 participants and 
            got an appointment in a usability testing lab. To prepare for the tests, we 
            borrowed a clean phone so that there were no distractions and printed out the 
            script. We downloaded a screen recording software onto the phone so that we 
            could review the tests again later if we wanted to. Finally, we gathered 
            incentives for participants (copious amounts of chocolate).

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                There were inconsistent gestures. For example, pinching was 
                effective on most screens, but did nothing on the week screen. 
                Another example is that you could not pinch on the time or date 
                screens
            </li>
            <li>
                Another inconsistency stemmed from the tutorial, where there were 
                no gestures available, even as the tutorial explained what gestures 
                would be available in the app
            </li>
            <li>
                Some users found it confusing that the menu navigation was swiping
                down
            </li>
            <li>
                Users did not always read the tutorials, so they tried to tap on 
                the typing screen to bring a keyboard up
            </li>
            <li>
                Somre users had trouble navigating in spite of the presence of 
                tutorials
            </li>
            <li>
                Users expected to be able to tap the title bar to navigate, which 
                is something we added to the week view, but not the day view. It 
                was surprising that this was an intuitive way for them to navigate 
                and could be utilized more in future versions
            </li>
            <li>
                Within the typing tutorial, the action that would be completed 
                by a long hold was not clear
            </li>
            <li>
                It was unclear that you could scroll on the date screen
            </li>
            <li>
                Pinching was interpreted as "going back", probably due to poor 
                explanation in the tutorial, so users did not know when to pinch 
                and when not to
            </li>
            <li>
                Users started on the day view, which made some of them unaware 
                that a week view was available
            </li>
            <li>
                The way to bring up the menu is also inconsistent as the typing 
                screen shows a menu on long hold and the week view shows it when 
                the user swipes down
            </li>
            <li>
                Some users think it could be hard to do two-finger gestures on a 
                smart watch because of the screen size
            </li>
            <li>
                Some users think that tapping on a day in the week view could be 
                challenging because of the small size of the buttons
            </li>

        <h2>Lessons About the Prototype</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The tutorials and pickers should allow gestures consisten with 
                other screens
            </li>
            <li>
                The gesture for navigating to a menu on any screen should be 
                consistent
            </li>
            <li>
                Animations should reinforce tutorials so that users can use the app 
                even if they are not interested in reading the tutorials
            </li>
            <li>The app should start on the week view</li>
            <li>
                The typing tutorial should explicitly say that long-holding brings 
                up a menu with the different options
            </li>
            <li>
                Tapping on the title bar in the day view should bring the user to 
                the week view. This can be in addition to another gesture, but it 
                should be an option
            </li>
            <li>
                Items on the day view should be cut off so it is clear the user can 
                scroll
            </li>
            <li>
                We should re-evaluate which gesture can be used to "go back" in the 
                app
            </li>
            <li>
                A save button should be added to the bottom of the add event screen 
                to prevent confusion over whether or not changes will be saved
            </li>
            <li>
                We should consider allowing users to hold on the week view so that 
                they can ensure that they are selecting the right day before they 
                release.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Lessons About Usability Testing</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                You should <b>clearly explain</b>, possibly multiple times, what 
                <b>the idea of the prototype</b> is. If the prototype is not on 
                the device it would be used on, or there are any differences in 
                the interface from what would be the final product, make those 
                clear in the beginning to avoid confusion and get clear feedback.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Testing the equipment beforehand</b> would have really helpful. 
                It would have been even better to reserve extra time in the lab to 
                practice a test to make sure that everything runs correctly. The 
                first test we had, the screen recorder stopped half way through 
                because it had a default setting of five minutes. That could have 
                been prevented if we had done a dry-run.
            </li>
            <li>
                We should <b>plan the number of participants that we will have</b> 
                beforehand. Since we already had reserved the lab for only an hour 
                by the time we started gathering participants, we were very limited 
                with how many we could accept. This meant that we did not get as 
                much data as we could have and that we did not have enough time to 
                prepare well before the first test because we wanted to use as much 
                time gathering data as we could.
            </li>
            <li>
                It was really helpful to <b>use a prototyping utility that lets 
                you quickly and easily restart the prototype remotely</b>. This way, 
                if there was an error in the experience, the observer could restart 
                the prototype without distracting the tester from the experience 
                too much. This also allowed the observer to help set up for the next 
                tester while the person running the test was debriefing the last 
                tester and giving them their incentive. It made the process much 
                smoother and easier overall.
            </li>
            <li>
                We should have <b>prepared answers to questions we thought might be 
                asked during the test beforehand</b>. There were some times when we 
                were unsure if or how we should answer a question or problem that 
                the tester encountered, so it would have been nice to have a general 
                idea of things we could say in response and how we would handle 
                certain problems if they occurred.
