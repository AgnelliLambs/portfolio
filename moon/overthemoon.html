					<h1>Over the Moon!</h1>
					<p>Over the Moon! is an app designed to allow climbers to catalog
						and share bouldering problems on system walls, which are walls with
						a high density of holds, and no predetermined routes. The app was designed
						to allow users to upload pictures of their wall, and create 
						the route within the app.</p>

					<p>I started by designing this as a website, this was one of the first
						sketches I made for the project. Eventually, as I began implementing 
						my design I decided that Over The Moon should be developed
						as a mobile app, rather than a website. Even later, I decided that it should be neither,
	    					 and should instead just be a notebook and a pen that can be kept next to the wall.</p>
    					<p>This is a very keen reminder in my memory that it can be good to start by thinking simple,
						and expand from there.</p>

					<p>After making the paper sketches, I created each page as a wireframe in NinjaMock.
					and gave them functionality <a href = "https://invis.io/VEFV0DXDU97">here on Invision.</a></p>

					<p>I decided to do some user testing. When I asked people to find a problem and add it to their favorites,
					 they were unable to do so, I had forgotten to add a page with a favorited item. 
					 I also found that everything generally a bit too condensed on the original mockups, 
					 making buttons harder to click. I fixed that by removing some unnecessary items.</p>
					 <p>I re-made every page in Sketch, this time focusing on fixing all the issues that arose
					 	during my interviews. As an aside, at some point I realized that I didn't like my font,
					 	but I found a Sketch plugin to let me find and replace fonts. </p>
