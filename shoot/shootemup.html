					<h1>Shoot 'em Up</h1>
					<p>I worked in a group of 4 to make a multiplayer videogame that allows
						any of the users to host the server on their own machines.</p>
					<img src="server.png"></img>
					<p>Our group met every week to discuss what each of our responsibilities
						would be for the following week and to talk about the progress we made.
						Unfortunately, I no longer have any of the sketches we made during
						these meetings.</p>
					<img src="screencap.png"></img>
					<p>Overall, the project was a terrific success! We met all of our goals
						well ahead of time, and we were able to incorporate added functionality,
						like in game terrain, and chat commands.</p>
					<img src="launcher.png"></img>
					<p>This project started because my group wanted to do more than was 
						required to do well on the assignment. Instead we met frequently, 
						and divided the labor in a way that allowed us to get significantly 
						more done</p>
					<h3>The Biggest Challenge</h3>
					<p>At one point, about after we had integrated the server, the game started
						being very laggy. At the time, we were sending information to the client
						every game tick. After a while, I realized that instead, we could just
						send the trajectory of each object, rather than the object itself. 
						That let us do server updates far less frequently, after that all the
						server communication ran smoothly.</p>
