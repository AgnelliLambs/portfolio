            In step 3, we found a few critical issues with our design that we needed to remediate. 
            This included some simple things, like the size of certain buttons, to more complicated
            issues, like confusing navigation.              
        </p>
        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>
            We needed to decide on a prototyping tool to help us generate our designs. Our primary criteria
            was that this tool would allow us to use pinching as an interaction method, since that was central
            to our design. Unfourtunatly, this significantly narrowed down our options. In fact, the only
            tool we could find that could accomplish this is <a href = "https://www.protopie.io/"> Protopie </a>.
            This tool has some pretty unfourtunate drawbacks. Primarily, the types of animations are very limited, 
            and we don't have any direct control over the timing. Still, we wen't forward.
        </p>
        <h3>Changes</h3>
        <p>
            There were a few things that we'd either designed in lo-fi, or discussed that were changed
            when we created our hi-fi prototypes. Initially, we expected the week view to have more color,
            and we expected the day view to display as bubble, rather than cards. Both of these were changed.
            We also decided to add some tutorials on using the app, to explain some of the more novel interaction
            methods, and most importantly, animation.
        </p>

        <h3>Animation</h3>
        <p> Animation was always expected to be an important part of the app. The simplest way to convey 
            the navigational heirarchy of the app we could think of was to include animations. For instance,
            if a page slides in from the top, to close it, you would swipe from the bottom to the top. If a
            page pops up (using the classic 'pop' animation), you will close it by pinching. Ultimatly,
            these animations should help the app to be more intuitive to use.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="blueSect">
        <h2>Planned Changes</h2>
        <p>
            All pages will use pinch to exit, instead of swiping down. The 
            animations will reflect this. On any page, they should be able 
            to long press to bring up button versions of the available actions.
